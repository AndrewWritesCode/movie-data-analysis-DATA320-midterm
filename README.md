*this notebook is intended to be used with a MongoDB deployment, the credentials are not provided. You will need to comment out the cells of the notebook that fetch the data from MongoDB, and uncomment the cells that import the dataset from a csv if you want to run it without the MongoDB deployment. If importing from the csv, the movie years range from 2014-2020.
